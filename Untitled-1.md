**Node.js with TypeScript Assignment**

This project is a simple Node.js application that uses TypeScript. It includes a basic Express server and a few example routes.

**Getting Started**

To get started, you will need to install Node.js and TypeScript. You can do this by following the instructions on the Node.js and TypeScript websites.

Once you have installed Node.js and TypeScript, you can clone this repository and install the dependencies by running the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/username/node.js-with-typescript-assignment.git
cd node.js-with-typescript-assignment
npm install
```

**Running the Application**

To run the application, you can use the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the Node.js application using Nodemon, which will automatically restart the server whenever you make changes to the code.

**Code Overview**

The code for this application is located in the `app.ts` file. This file includes the following:

- Import statements for the Express and TypeScript libraries
- A class called `Server` that defines the Express server
- A method called `start` that starts the Express server

The following code snippet shows the `Server` class:

```typescript
import express from "express";

class Server {
  private app: express.Application;

  constructor() {
    this.app = express();
  }

  public start() {
    this.app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log("Server is listening on port 3000");
    });
  }
}
```

The following code snippet shows the `start` method:

```typescript
public start() {
  this.app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is listening on port 3000');
  });
}
```

This method starts the Express server on port 3000.

**Example Routes**

The application includes a few example routes that you can use to test the server. These routes are defined in the `routes.ts` file.

The following code snippet shows the `routes.ts` file:

```typescript
import express from 'express';

const router = express.Router();

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
